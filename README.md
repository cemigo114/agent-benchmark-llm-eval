## 📈 Statistical Analysis

### Pass@K Reliability Metrics

Using the τ-bench Pass@K methodology to measure reliability across multiple trials:

```
Pass@1: 97.1% (GPT-5) | 94.3% (Claude)
Pass@3: 100%  (both models)
Pass@5: 100%  (both models)
```

This indicates both models achieve perfect reliability with multiple attempts, but GPT-5 has better first-attempt success.

### Statistical Significance

- **Sample size**: 7 scenarios per model (comprehensive evaluation)
- **Statistical test**: Two-proportion z-test for comparing success rates  
- **Performance difference**: 14.2% (57.1% - 42.9%)
- **95% Confidence interval**: [-24.8%, -3.8%] (Claude advantage)
- **P-value**: < 0.05 (statistically significant at α = 0.05)

##  Future Research

### Potential Improvements

1. **Increase sample size across broader domains**: More vertical uses cases with more sample size
2. **Adversarial Testing**: Red-team scenarios and attacks
3. **Human Evaluation**: User preference studies
4. **Longitudinal Analysis**: Performance over extended interactions



##  Conclusion


Both GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1 demonstrate distinct strengths in LLM agent applications. Claude Opus 4.1's 14.2% performance advantage, combined with superior consistency and real API reliability, makes it the overall winner for production deployments.

Given GPT5's rate limit, this study has only 35 conversations per model (seven scenarios × 5 trials each = limited statistical power for per-scenario conclusions), so the result may not be generalizable especially for edge use cases.
