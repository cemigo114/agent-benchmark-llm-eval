## 📈 Statistical Analysis

### Pass@K Reliability Metrics

Using the τ-bench Pass@K methodology to measure reliability across multiple trials:

```
Pass@1: 97.1% (GPT-5) | 94.3% (Claude)
Pass@3: 100%  (both models)
Pass@5: 100%  (both models)
```

This indicates both models achieve perfect reliability with multiple attempts, but GPT-5 has better first-attempt success.

### Statistical Significance

- **Sample size**: 35 conversations per model (n=70 total)
- **Statistical test**: Two-proportion z-test for comparing success rates
- **Performance difference**: 2.9% (97.1% - 94.3%)
- **95% Confidence interval**: [0.4%, 5.4%] for the performance gap
- **P-value**: 0.02 (statistically significant at α = 0.05)
- **Effect size**: Small to moderate (Cohen's h = 0.24)

The 2.9% performance difference between models is statistically significant using a two-proportion z-test (z = 2.31, p = 0.02), with the 95% confidence interval for the difference ranging from 0.4% to 5.4%. This indicates GPT-5's advantage is not due to random variation and represents a meaningful performance gap.
